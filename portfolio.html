					<h5>Description</h5>
					<p >
Irbis is a 2D boss rush style game based upon the older Metroid games. With very minimal story elements, the purpose of the game is simply to defeat all the bosses.
There are no platforming and no ‘run&gun’ style levels; though, there is a survival mode in the works. A total of five bosses are planned, each with their own unique
stages (starting with the cave, then plains, hill, mountaintop, and finally the keep) and ability sets.
<br><br>
The first boss, the lizard (technical name: “Lizard Guy Boss
(rawr)” it’s a working title) is mechanically complete, though completely untested, riddled with bugs, and lacking animations. The lizard has a combination of doodles,
concept art, and arrows in place of where animations would be to show that the animation system is fully functional. 
<br><br>
While multiple difficulties are planned (easy, medium, hard, and an insane being unlocked after beating hard) the game is being built to be hard. The intention is to
have to try the boss four or five times to try and learn its mechanics before being able to beat it. This is very much inspired by metroid bosses and world of warcraft
bosses.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h5>My contribution</h5>
					<p >
This entire game is my creation. Whereas with other projects I would usually try to guide my team to keep us on track, this was the first project where I really had
full control of everything. Some things were added during development, such as: survival mode and enchantments. However, everything else has been planned since the
beginning. The movement system, bosses, gameplay, etc were already determined before starting. The exact details, of course, weren’t clear yet, but all the ideas were
known.
<br><br>
At first, I only had Pulex to help me with art. I’d heard of some games (axiom verge, fez) where one person was able to animate, program and do most
everything. However, once I tried my hand at pixel animation, it became clear that I wasn't one of those people.
<br><br>
In addition to the coding and design, I also created the font, UI elements, logos, and stick figures that were used in the game.

					<h5>Description</h5>
					<p >
The most unique game I’ve worked on, I believe, is Cat Burglary. Unlike the other video games, Cat Burglary has a story. The cooperative game stars two felines
attempting to steal treasure from their former colleague. You see, the three of them used to be skilled team of burglars, having pulled off many successful heists,
until betrayed. The two playable characters went to prison after the betrayal, but now they’re free and must steal back all their treasure!
<br><br>
The game is broken into two main segments: the day phase and the night phase. During the day phase, the players must stake out the level, learn the patrols, determine
where the treasure is, and not get caught being too suspicious. Originally, the plan was that when the players became too suspicious, they would be forced into the
night phase less than prepared. The night phase is when things went down, taking what they learned during the day, the players now have to avoid traps, open doors
and not get seen be guard dogs. Oh, and retrieve their treasure!
<br><br>
Cat Burglary was very much intended to be a cooperative puzzle game, relying on teamwork to complete objectives. You can see traces of cooperative elements in the
game, but as this was a school project, we didn’t have the right amount of time to really rock out some excellent level design. Because of this, the game feels very
hollow. I think we had a very good idea, but not enough time to implement it properly.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h5>My contribution</h5>
					<p >
I did most of the scripting in the game. If there is a script in the game, it’s very likely that I either made it entirely, or heavily modified something made by Joe
or DeVante. Some of my favorite scripts to work on were the AI, traps, suspicion system (which increases when seen by an AI and when near a suspicious object, like
traps), and the characters themselves. I left some things, like level design/creation and animation, to Joe and DeVante, respectively. Code is where I thrive, and I
spent most of my time making or fixing scripts.
<br><br>
Something I am rather proud of is the UI element in the center. Though, it doesn't look very fancy, I thought it was an interesting and clear way to convey the players'
suspicion level.

					<a href='vimentis.html' class='gametitle'>Vi Mentis</a>
					<h5>Description</h5>
					<p >
The main mechanic is Vi Mentis is world rotation. The player is able to, at any time, rotate the world, using their location as the pivot. From the beginning, I thought this was a really awesome idea. It took much longer than I wanted to get it implemented in the way you see in the video. And in the short time I had left, I never came up with a solution to the problem of “Should we rotate the level in the player’s current direction?”
<br><br>
I think with some good level design, and snapping the rotational axis to the nearest 90 degrees, Vi Mentis could have been a very good puzzle game. As it stands, I think it’s a decent proof of concept. 
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the project was held back for several reasons, the first of which is team size. This was my first group game design project, so I didn’t take the lead as much as I should have. We had seven people supposedly working on the project, but I never saw anything come from four of them (and I never even met them!) Hollis was not a programmer, and ended up just writing the blog posts and whatever other documents needed to be made, which left Joe and I to largely create the game by our selves.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h5>My contribution</h5>
					<p >
Joe would often make scripts and not know how to make them work, and I would look at his code, figure out what he was trying to do with it, and make it do that. Of the two main mechanics, gravity flipping and world rotation, I created both. We also originally had a third-person controller, and I was able (somewhat sloppily) convert this into a first-person controller.
<br><br>
In addition to most of the scripting, I also created the logo for “Horizon Lab,” the setting of the game, the square texture, and the tile texture which was used and stretched and made very blurry on the floating maze object.

					<h5>Description</h5>
					<p >
Fugitive was my first ever official game project I’d worked on. The board itself, being broken into hexagons and randomly arranged each time, was based on Settlers of Catan. The gameplay, however, was completely original.
<br><br>
There are three types of players in each game: the fugitive, the detective, and the searchers. The fugitive’s objective is to stay hidden for as long as possible, the detective must use their knowledge of the fugitive’s previous whereabouts to assist the searchers, and the searchers have to find the fugitive to win. The kicker, however, is that every turn, the control of the fugitive moves to the player to the left, and the player that played the fugitive last turn is now the detective.
<br><br>

					<br>
					<h5>My contribution</h5>
					<p >
This was a solo project, so everything was made and designed by me. Although, if you look closely, you may be able to recognize the backgrounds used on the cards as some of the Wrath of the Lich King concept art!
