				This is flippy, the burger flipping robot. As of right now, flippy only manages the burger cooking. An employee recieves the burger, administers the toppings, and delivers it to the customers. Robots like flippy are great for automation and increasing efficiency, but what is lost in the process? Having human quality assurance is an important part of any good/service. For instance, what if the heat sensor breaks in flippy, and they start sending out frozen patties?

				F.I.R.S.T. robotics is a series of robotics competitions where students from middle school to college will compete with a robot they design, build, and program. A significant portion of the competition is autonomous, meaning the robot must move on its own and make decisions without human input. This is a primitive form of artificial intelligence. Schools and instructors teach and push these competitors to learn more about programming, without any classes on the ethics of programming. Information is power that can be a tool or a weapon. Should we be arming children with such a powerful weapon?

				Project Maven is a joint effort between the Department of Defense and Google. The focus of this operation is to use artificial intelligence to process drone footage and to identify objects within the footage. The reason the DoD is turning to AI for this task is that they collect tremendous amounts of footage daily, too much for human analysts to keep up with. So far Maven is able to identify objects from 38 separate categories automatically. Currently, Maven is not used in combat applications but it has been in use since December.

				Artificial Intelligence has come a long way since it was first introduced, but it still has many hurdles to surmount. Currently AI is used in many benign applications, but it is starting to be used for more important tasks. One of these tasks is correctly identifying objects within an image or from footage. An example is of this being AI misidentified two skiers as a dog. As of now AI is having a hard time with this, and it is proving difficult to correct.

				It is a very real possibility that, one day, robots and artificial intelligence will make humans obsolete. In fact, for many jobs that fleshy organisms once held, like pulling carriages and assembly lines, are now performed by machines. We once believed that robots could only handle simple, repetitive tasks, those that can be defined with math. But the truth is, robots have us beat in many situations already. Self-driving cars and trucks will soon take many transportation jobs, screens and self-checkouts take more service jobs every year, and even music is being written by robots now.

				Now that self-driving cars are becoming a part of our everyday lives, there are a few questions that need answering. One of the biggest is reminiscent of the trolley problem. Do you change the tracks to kill five people, or let the trolley continue and kill only one? Everything the AI controlling a self-driving car has to be programmed. If the car is on a collision course that would kill the driver, does the car change directions, killing a pedestrian? It’s a rare situation, but with so many cars on the road, it is one that will happen eventually, along with countless others. Whose safety does the AI prioritize?

				Imagine bullets raining down from the sky from a tiny little drone. It may seem outlandish, but it’s not that far off, the defense department is designing small robotic jets that will fly into combat alongside manned aircrafts. CAMP EDWARDS, Mass. — The small drone, with its six whirring rotors, swept past the replica of a Middle Eastern village and closed in on a mosque-like structure, its camera scanning for targets. Do think it’s a good step ahead or a bad one?

				Do you think having your own drone would be cool? Some thing that could be controlled so easily without an controller! Well Skydio has created the R1, as it’s called, is an artificial intelligence-powered quadcopter capable of shooting 4K video of a subject and maneuvering complex environments all on its own. Using industry advancements in AI to help train a custom computer vision system, Skydio developed a product that’s effectively the first professional-grade drone that can be flown without any expertise whatsoever, the company claims. It uses 13 built in cameras and built in algorithms to learn to recognize objects like:humans, trees,etc. It also follows the user around. This innovation in engineering is nice, but how will it affect the future?
